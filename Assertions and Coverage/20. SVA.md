# <p align = center> SystemVerilog assertions (SVA) </p>
SVA are constructs used to validate and check properties of digital systems during simulation or formal verification. Assertions help verify design functionality, detect errors early, and document design behavior, making them valuable for both RTL design and verification engineers.

SystemVerilog supports two main types of assertions:

1. **Immediate Assertions**: Evaluated instantaneously when encountered in a procedural block.
2. **Concurrent Assertions**: Evaluate conditions over time, synchronized to a clock, and can check sequences of events.

## Immediate Assertions

### Definition
Immediate assertions are evaluated instantly at the moment they are encountered in simulation, typically within procedural blocks like `always`, `initial`, or tasks.

### Syntax
```systemverilog
assert (expression) else $fatal("Error message");
```

### Characteristics
- **Evaluated Instantly**: Only at the simulation time it is encountered.
- **Error Handling**: If the condition is false, an optional message can be output, and simulation can be stopped.
- **Procedural Use**: Often found in procedural blocks and useful for quick, single-cycle checks.

### Example
```systemverilog
module immediate_assert_example;
    logic [7:0] data;

    initial begin
        data = 8'b10101010;
        assert (data[7] == 1) else $fatal("MSB is not set!");
    end
endmodule
```
In this example, an immediate assertion checks if the most significant bit (MSB) of `data` is `1`. If it isn’t, the `$fatal` statement will print an error and terminate the simulation.

## Concurrent Assertions

### Definition
Concurrent assertions are evaluated over time, typically across multiple clock cycles, allowing for temporal checks (sequence-based) and are synchronized to a clock edge. These assertions are ideal for verifying sequences of events or conditions that must hold over time.

### Syntax
Concurrent assertions are defined using properties and are checked with the `assert` keyword.

```systemverilog
property property_name;
    @(posedge clk) expression;
endproperty

assert property (property_name) else $fatal("Error message");
```

### Characteristics
- **Clock Synchronized**: Triggered based on a specific clock event.
- **Temporal Expressions**: Support sequence-based expressions, enabling checks for multi-cycle behaviors.
- **Flexible and Powerful**: Can verify complex design properties, such as protocol compliance, timing constraints, and multi-stage pipeline flows.

### Example
```systemverilog
module concurrent_assert_example;
    logic clk;
    logic reset;
    logic valid;
    logic ready;

    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #5 clk = ~clk;  // 10-time-unit clock period
    end

    // Define a property to check if 'valid' is followed by 'ready' within two cycles
    property valid_ready_check;
        @(posedge clk) valid |-> ##[1:2] ready;
    endproperty

    // Assertion based on the property
    assert property (valid_ready_check) else $fatal("Ready did not follow valid within two cycles");
endmodule
```
In this example:
- The `valid_ready_check` property checks that `ready` is asserted within one to two cycles after `valid` is asserted.
- If the condition isn’t met, the assertion fails, and `$fatal` stops the simulation with an error message.

## SystemVerilog Assertion Operators

SystemVerilog assertions come with specialized operators that support temporal and sequence checking:

- **Implication (`|->`, `|=>`)**: Used to indicate that one condition implies another. `|->` checks sequences; `|=>` is used in properties.
- **Consecutive Delay (`##n`)**: Specifies a delay of `n` clock cycles.
- **Within Delay (`##[min:max]`)**: Specifies a variable delay range for matching events.
- **And (`and`)** / **Or (`or`)**: Combine conditions within assertions.
- **Not (`!`)**: Checks if a condition does not hold.

---

## Advanced Example: Sequence and Property with Multiple Conditions

```systemverilog
module advanced_assert_example;
    logic clk, reset;
    logic req, ack;

    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #5 clk = ~clk; // Generate a clock
    end

    // Property: If 'req' is high, then 'ack' should become high within two cycles
    property request_acknowledge;
        @(posedge clk) req |-> ##[1:2] ack;
    endproperty

    // Use the property in an assertion
    assert property (request_acknowledge) else $error("ack did not follow req within 2 cycles");
endmodule
```

In this example:
1. The `request_acknowledge` property checks that if `req` is high, `ack` should become high within one to two clock cycles.
2. If `ack` does not go high within two cycles after `req`, the assertion fails and `$error` prints an error message.

## Summary

### Immediate Assertions
- **Evaluated**: Instantly, when encountered in procedural code.
- **Ideal for**: Single-cycle checks.
- **Example**: Checking that a specific bit is set.

### Concurrent Assertions
- **Evaluated**: Over multiple clock cycles, synchronized to a specific clock edge.
- **Ideal for**: Sequence-based and multi-cycle temporal checks.
- **Example**: Verifying that a ready signal follows a valid signal within two cycles.

SystemVerilog assertions provide a powerful framework for validating digital designs by enabling engineers to specify conditions that must hold during simulation or formal verification. Immediate assertions are great for quick checks, while concurrent assertions allow for complex, time-based conditions, making SV assertions essential in modern digital verification.
