## Immediate Assertions

### Definition
**Immediate assertions** are assertions that are evaluated at the exact time they are encountered during simulation. They are primarily used for quick checks of conditions at specific points in time.

### Characteristics
- **Triggered Instantly**: Evaluated as soon as they are encountered during simulation.
- **Procedural Context**: Used inside procedural blocks (e.g., `always`, `initial`, or `task` blocks).
- **Simple Condition Check**: Useful for simple condition checks that need to happen immediately.

### Syntax
```systemverilog
assert (expression) else $fatal("Assertion failed");
```

### Usage
- **One-Time Check**: To validate specific conditions that must hold at a particular point in time.
- **Debugging**: Useful in debugging and identifying errors quickly within procedural blocks.

### Example
```systemverilog
module immediate_assertion_example;
    logic clk;
    logic [3:0] data;

    initial begin
        data = 4'b1001;
        assert (data[3] == 1) else $fatal("MSB of data is not set!"); // Immediate check
    end
endmodule
```

### Explanation
- This example checks if the most significant bit of `data` is set.
- If `data[3]` is not `1`, the assertion fails, and `$fatal` halts the simulation, printing an error message.

## Concurrent Assertions

### Definition
**Concurrent assertions** are assertions that evaluate conditions over time, typically synchronized to a specific clock. They are often used to validate temporal conditions, like sequence checks, and are evaluated at each clock cycle.

### Characteristics
- **Evaluated Over Time**: Used to check conditions that span multiple clock cycles or events.
- **Clock-Based**: Synchronized with a clock, allowing for continuous monitoring of specified conditions.
- **Temporal Expressions**: Support temporal expressions like sequences and properties, making them suitable for validating sequential behaviors.

### Syntax
Concurrent assertions are defined using `property` and `assert` statements and synchronized with a clock.

```systemverilog
property prop_name;
    @(posedge clk) expression; // Define the property with a clock
endproperty

assert property (prop_name) else $fatal("Concurrent assertion failed");
```

### Usage
- **Monitoring Conditions Over Time**: To validate conditions that must hold true across multiple clock cycles.
- **Sequence and Timing Checks**: Useful for checking protocols, timing constraints, and specific signal sequences.

### Example
```systemverilog
module concurrent_assertion_example;
    logic clk;
    logic reset;
    logic ready;

    // Clock generation
    initial begin
        clk = 0;
        forever #5 clk = ~clk; // 10-time-unit period
    end

    // Define a property for a reset sequence check
    property reset_sequence_check;
        @(posedge clk) disable iff (reset)
            ready |=> ##1 !ready; // ready must be followed by !ready in the next cycle
    endproperty

    // Assert the property
    assert property (reset_sequence_check) else $fatal("Reset sequence assertion failed");
endmodule
```

### Explanation
- This example defines a `reset_sequence_check` property that checks if `ready` is followed by `!ready` on the next clock cycle.
- The `|=>` operator specifies a sequence condition where `ready` should transition to `!ready` one cycle after `ready` is asserted.
- If the assertion fails, `$fatal` is called to stop the simulation and print an error.

## Summary

### Immediate Assertions
- **Definition**: Assertions that check conditions at the exact simulation time they are encountered.
- **Characteristics**: Triggered instantly, used in procedural contexts, and suitable for simple checks.
- **Example**: Check if the MSB of `data` is set to `1`.

### Concurrent Assertions
- **Definition**: Assertions that validate conditions over time and are synchronized to a clock.
- **Characteristics**: Used for sequential and timing-based checks, validated every clock cycle.
- **Example**: Verify that `ready` transitions to `!ready` in the next clock cycle.

SystemVerilog assertions (both immediate and concurrent) are powerful tools for verifying design properties, helping detect errors early and improving the robustness of digital designs.
