## 1. Blocking Assignments

### Definition
Blocking assignments are executed in a sequential manner, meaning that the next statement will not execute until the current assignment is completed. They are typically used in combinational logic and are denoted by the `=` operator.

### Characteristics
- **Sequential Execution**: The execution of blocking assignments happens in the order they are written. The next statement waits for the current one to complete.
- **Immediate Update**: The variable is updated immediately after the assignment.
- **Usage in Combinational Logic**: Commonly used in `always` blocks for combinational logic design.

### Example
```systemverilog
module blocking_example;
    logic a, b;
    logic y;

    // Combinational logic using blocking assignments
    always @(*) begin
        y = a;  // Blocking assignment
        b = y;  // Blocking assignment; b will get the updated value of y immediately
    end
endmodule
```

### Execution Flow
In the example above:
1. When `a` changes, `y` is assigned the value of `a`.
2. The next line assigns `b` the value of `y`. Since this is a blocking assignment, `b` gets the updated value of `y` immediately after the assignment.

## 2. Non-Blocking Assignments

### Definition
Non-blocking assignments allow for concurrent execution of assignments. They are used primarily in sequential logic and are denoted by the `<=` operator. In non-blocking assignments, the right-hand side is evaluated immediately, but the assignment is scheduled to occur later, allowing other statements to execute in the meantime.

### Characteristics
- **Concurrent Execution**: Non-blocking assignments enable concurrent execution, meaning the next statement can execute before the current assignment completes.
- **Delayed Update**: The variable is updated at the end of the time step or simulation cycle.
- **Usage in Sequential Logic**: Commonly used in `always` blocks to model flip-flops and registers.

### Example
```systemverilog
module non_blocking_example;
    logic clk;
    logic reset;
    logic [3:0] count;

    // Sequential logic using non-blocking assignments
    always @(posedge clk or posedge reset) begin
        if (reset) begin
            count <= 4'b0000; // Non-blocking assignment
        end else begin
            count <= count + 1; // Non-blocking assignment; count gets updated later
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Execution Flow
In the example above:
1. On the rising edge of `clk` or when `reset` is asserted, the `always` block is triggered.
2. If `reset` is true, `count` is scheduled to be set to `4'b0000`.
3. If `reset` is false, `count` is scheduled to be incremented by 1.
4. The updates occur at the end of the time step, after all statements in the `always` block have been evaluated.

## Summary
### Blocking Assignments
- **Syntax**: `=` (e.g., `y = a;`)
- **Execution**: Sequential; the next statement waits for the current assignment to finish.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for combinational logic.

### Non-Blocking Assignments
- **Syntax**: `<=` (e.g., `count <= count + 1;`)
- **Execution**: Concurrent; the next statement can execute while the current assignment is pending.
- **Usage**: Commonly used for sequential logic to model registers and flip-flops.

### Key Differences
- **Blocking**: Immediate assignment and sequential execution.
- **Non-Blocking**: Delayed assignment and concurrent execution.

Understanding the difference between blocking and non-blocking assignments is crucial for writing correct and efficient SystemVerilog code, especially in the context of hardware design. Blocking assignments are used for combinational logic, while non-blocking assignments are essential for correctly modeling sequential logic.
