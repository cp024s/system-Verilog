## 1. For Loop

### Definition
The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specific number of times. It consists of an initialization section, a condition, and an increment/decrement operation.

### Characteristics
- **Syntax**:
  ```systemverilog
  for (initialization; condition; increment) begin
      // code to execute
  end
  ```
- **Control Flow**: The loop runs while the condition is true, and the initialization and increment/decrement are controlled within the loop declaration.
- **Flexibility**: Can iterate over a specified range, making it versatile for various applications.

### Usage
- **Iterative Tasks**: Useful for tasks that require repetitive execution based on a counter or condition.
- **Array Operations**: Commonly used for iterating through arrays.

### Example
```systemverilog
module for_loop_example;
    logic [3:0] sum;
    logic [3:0] i;

    initial begin
        sum = 0;

        // For loop to calculate the sum of the first 10 integers
        for (i = 0; i < 10; i = i + 1) begin
            sum = sum + i; // Accumulate sum
        end

        $display("Sum of first 10 integers: %d", sum); // Outputs: 45
    end
endmodule
```

### Execution Flow
1. The loop initializes `i` to `0`.
2. The condition checks if `i` is less than `10`.
3. The code inside the loop executes, accumulating the sum.
4. After each iteration, `i` is incremented by `1`.
5. The loop exits when `i` reaches `10`.

## 2. While Loop

### Definition
The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. It is primarily used when the number of iterations is not known in advance.

### Characteristics
- **Syntax**:
  ```systemverilog
  while (condition) begin
      // code to execute
  end
  ```
- **Precondition Check**: The condition is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is false at the beginning, the loop may not execute at all.
- **Flexibility**: Suitable for situations where the number of iterations depends on dynamic conditions.

### Usage
- **Dynamic Conditions**: Ideal for processes where the number of iterations is determined by runtime conditions.

### Example
```systemverilog
module while_loop_example;
    logic [3:0] count;
    
    initial begin
        count = 0;

        // While loop to count until count reaches 5
        while (count < 5) begin
            $display("Count: %d", count); // Display current count
            count = count + 1; // Increment count
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Execution Flow
1. The loop checks if `count` is less than `5`.
2. If true, it displays the current count and increments `count`.
3. The loop continues until `count` reaches `5`, at which point it terminates.

---

## 3. Repeat Loop

### Definition
The `repeat` loop executes a block of code a fixed number of times, specified in the loop declaration.

### Characteristics
- **Syntax**:
  ```systemverilog
  repeat (n) begin
      // code to execute
  end
  ```
- **Fixed Iterations**: The number of iterations is determined at the time of writing the code and does not change during execution.
- **Simplified Syntax**: Useful for scenarios where a specific number of executions is required.

### Usage
- **Fixed Count Operations**: Ideal for tasks where you know the exact number of repetitions needed.

### Example
```systemverilog
module repeat_loop_example;
    logic [3:0] i;

    initial begin
        // Repeat loop to display numbers from 0 to 4
        repeat (5) begin
            $display("Current iteration: %d", i);
            i = i + 1; // Increment i
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Execution Flow
1. The loop executes the block `5` times.
2. The value of `i` is displayed and incremented in each iteration.

## 4. Forever Loop

### Definition
The `forever` loop continuously executes a block of code until it is explicitly terminated, usually by a break condition or an event outside the loop.

### Characteristics
- **Syntax**:
  ```systemverilog
  forever begin
      // code to execute
  end
  ```
- **Infinite Execution**: Runs indefinitely unless there is a termination condition within the loop.
- **Event Handling**: Often used for generating continuous signals or events in testbenches.

### Usage
- **Continuous Processes**: Useful for scenarios where a process must run indefinitely, such as clock generation.

### Example
```systemverilog
module forever_loop_example;
    logic clk;

    initial begin
        clk = 0;

        // Forever loop to generate a clock signal
        forever begin
            #5 clk = ~clk; // Toggle clock every 5 time units
        end
    end
endmodule
```

### Execution Flow
1. The `forever` loop runs indefinitely.
2. The clock signal `clk` is toggled every `5` time units.
